# `update-from-npm` daily scripts

This folder contains 2 daily scripts used to update the database with data related to `npm`.

The 2 scripts are launched sequentially by the command: `npm run daily-npm-update`.

This command is launched when the `npm` branch is built, on SemaphoreCI server (see `ci-build.sh` file).
